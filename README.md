### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I am a technical professional with specialized training in Web Application Development (CFGS DAW) and a master's degree in iOS and Android development. Since 2010, my professional career has focused on native software development for Apple products such as macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS. During this time, I have continued to update and expand my knowledge in other languages and technologies, although my main focus remains native development using Objective-C, Swift (including SwiftUI) as programming languages.

In addition to my software development experience, I also possess skills in technical team and project management, as well as experience in using continuous integration platforms for application deployment and testing, and in applying Clean Code design patterns and architectures in project development.

I have worked on a wide variety of iOS development projects, including the 'FÃ¡brica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre' (Spain public administration), El Corte InglÃ©s, Carrefour PASS, Lidl Zaragoza, Bankinter MÃ³vil, Bankintercard, Agro Santander, and Guudjob.

If you are looking for a committed and experienced developer for your project, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you very much.
